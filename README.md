## Getting Started with the Project

Planning:

I began by outlining the necessary components. The first step was fetching data from the API, followed by implementing the form for creating new thoughts. Next, I integrated the like button functionality along with displaying the number of likes. Finally, I focused on styling the components for a cohesive user interface.

### The Problem

1. Problem: New thoughts not refreshing without page reload.

Solution: Utilized useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and update thoughts from the API dynamically.

2. Problem: Styling issues causing misalignment of elements.

Solution: Applied CSS classes and flexbox properties to align elements properly.

3. Problem:  
   I wanted to include a time stamp for each message, but that would disrupt the styling alignment. Therefore, the future was put on hold. I still need to work on passing data from child components via props and managing class names for styling.
